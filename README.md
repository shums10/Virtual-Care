#Problem Statement
1.An average US citizen spends $12,500 in a year on healthcare.
2.The average cost of a root canal in the United States ranges from about $700 to $1500. The average cost of a crown ranges from $800 to $3000. When  combining the cost of root canals and dental crowns, you can expect to pay between $1800 and $5000 or more.
3.A basic round of chemo can cost $10,000 to $100,000 or more. Additionally, many people need medication and chemotherapy at the same time.
